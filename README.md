# simple-tcp-chat
It is a simple tcp chat program using python 3 socket.
in this program two or multiple clients connect to server and they can chat with each other through one or multiple system in network.

## manual
For use it after download and unzip the files, run `server.py`.
if your server and client is on one system just run `client.py` after run server.
but if one or some of your clients are on diffrent systems you should change **ip** and **port** manualy from `config.json` file in each client system.
you should change them to your server **ip** in your network and the **port** that printed on server program after run.
then you can run `client.py` and start chat.


**Note**: you can access each system **ip** with [this manual](https://www.dnsstuff.com/scan-network-for-device-ip-address)

pip install socket
pip install
```

```
